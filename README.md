**Are you bored of Android Auto UI? You can't stand the fact that on your car you have two clocks on the screen? Do you want to personalize your look of Android Auto tweaking the UI to your likings?**

If yes is the answer to any of the questions above, you are in the right place!

Introducing my second Substratum Theme about Android Auto!

Extras For AA + Wallpapers For AA = ❤

Have you checked out my first substratum theme that changes Android Auto's default background? What are you waiting for? [Get Wallpapers For Android Auto now and tweak Android Auto even more!](https://github.com/shmykelsa/wp4aa-release)

This theme is open source! [Source here](https://github.com/shmykelsa/extras4aa)

SYNERGY SUPPORT IS (CURRENTLY) UNAVAILABLE DUE TO A LIMITATION OF SAMSUNG THEME STORE

Once installed be sure to head over to Substratum Manager and build your own look with the background of your choice!

What you can customize:

- Reduce or remove bottom bar of AA
- Reduce or remove status bar
- Customize the bar leaving just the launcher button or combine it with notifications button -and/or quick access app
- Swap the launcher button with the clock, thanks to madness mode (Android 8.0>)
- Pick your favourite gradient and apply it to what you'd like! Bar, widget or heads up notifications
- Customize colours of various things such as accent (bottom widget), bottom bar, caption of -apps
- Customize heads up notifications making them translucent, smaller, or even gradient-coloured!
- Choose between all the status bar customization
- Make notification center (or notifications) transparent
- Much more!

Known bugs:
- Overlays built stays pink on Substratum Lite after reboot
Workaround: please build & install an overlay with just the custom colours and then pick another extra. Or try to break down into various overlays. There's a limit of overall characters in Substratum, and picking the custom colors are already a lof of characters.

- Applying changes to bottom widget will result in a tiny rectangle around the icon
I have no clue on why this happens and whether it's fixable

- Gradient won't apply
Woraround: if you choose a gradient, also pick the extra to apply the gradient to what you want (bar, widget, heads up) to theme (possibly at the same time) and build & install. This should fix the gradient being not visible
Also, you might want to play around with the priorities tab in Substratum Lite. Based on my tests, putting the option of the gradient at the very bottom will make it appear.

- Madness modes displays the first 10 minutes with just one number
I don't have a fix at the moment

- I want Status Bar 0.9x but text looks weird
Install "Fix StatusB Height"

- I have changed my bottom bar colour but at every notification the icon is strange
Install "Fix new notifications"

- Extras For AA is making my Android Auto crashhhh broooOOO!!!!!!11!!!!
As a general good practice, please remember that after every Android Auto update all the options built with Extras For AA MUST be re-built again. Please also note that an Android Auto update might break the theme. So if you want to update Android Auto be sure to disable theme first, or it might be unusable, or wait for Extras For AA new release with the compatibility and then install new AA version. If you want to try out on your own, then update Android Auto and try to re-install whatever you've built before. If it works, then also let me know 

If Extras For AA gets updated is also a general good practice to make a clean install of overlays, so in order to avoid errors, uninstall previously built overlays, then you can install them again :)
