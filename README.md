**Are you bored of Android Auto UI? You can't stand the fact that on your car you have two clocks on the screen? Do you want to personalize your look of Android Auto tweaking the UI to your likings?**

If yes is the answer to any of the questions above, you are in the right place!

Introducing my second Substratum Theme about Android Auto!

Extras For AA + Wallpapers For AA = ‚ù§

Have you checked out my first substratum theme that changes Android Auto's default background? What are you waiting for? [Get Wallpapers For Android Auto now and tweak Android Auto even more!](https://github.com/shmykelsa/wp4aa-release)

This theme is open source! [Source here](https://github.com/shmykelsa/extras4aa)

SYNERGY SUPPORT IS (CURRENTLY) UNAVAILABLE DUE TO A LIMITATION OF SAMSUNG THEME STORE

Once installed be sure to head over to Substratum Manager and build your own look with the background of your choice!

What you can customize:

- Reduce or remove bottom bar of AA
- Reduce or remove status bar
- Customize the bar leaving just the launcher button or combine it with notifications button -and/or quick access app
- Swap the launcher button with the clock, thanks to madness mode
- Pick your favourite gradient and apply it to what you'd like! Bar, widget or heads up notifications
- Customize colours of various things such as accent (bottom widget), bottom bar, caption of -apps
- Customize heads up notifications making them translucent, smaller, or even gradient-coloured!
- Choose between all the status bar customization
- Make notification center (or notifications) transparent
- Much much more!

**NEW** 

Extras For AA now has a new version, dedicated to just icons for Android Auto. It's called Extras For AA Icons Special and features customization such as:

- Exit Icons

If Extras For AA gets updated is also a general good practice to make a clean install of overlays, so in order to avoid errors, uninstall previously built overlays, then you can install them again :)
